AccA is a frontend app for ACC.
ACC is a completely configurable tool that allows to control how your device charges:
   - Limit charging at a certain percentage
   - Shutdown the device when battery is too low (ex 5%)
   - Control battery temperatures and act accordingly
   - Schedule operations during night
   - Slow down charging
   - and much much more
You can find instructions for running acc at the [https://github.com/VR-25/acc/blob/master/README.md documentation].
The app requires root to read and write charging control files.
