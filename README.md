## DESCRIPTION

[AccA](https://github.com/MatteCarra/AccA) is an [acc](https://github.com/VR-25/acc) and [djs](https://github.com/VR-25/djs) front-end.
Both modules come bundled and are automatically installed as needed.

The app is developed with ordinary users in mind.
It targets mainly people and aliens alike who feel uncomfortable with terminal.
ACC and djs commands are still made available, though.

**PLEASE** read acc's documentation (README) **BEFORE** installing AccA!
It's available in Markdown and HTML formats from the link above.
All **disclaimers** and **warnings** listed there apply to this project as well!

If you point your finger at us, because you forgot to do your homework and your home got burned to the ground as a result, we'll simply ignore you.

Typically, we don't answer questions that already have well documented answers.
